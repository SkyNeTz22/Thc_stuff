Dispute over rules


After reflecting over last nights events during a baseraid that accured, I feel I need to write this ticket for the staff of GZ to read
------------------------------------------

From the GroundZero rulebook:

"1.5 Do NOT grief other players. Griefing is shooting ruining or despawning loot, shooting damaging or uncovering vehicles, and dismantling any part of a base that's not needed for entry."

The raiders uncovered the car, shot it and hit it during the hole time they were gaining access. They also dismantled 2 triangle floor at the top of the base and 2 windows inside, that clearly was not needed for entry
(They where already into that area due to legal means, such as with bombs and raidsledges) *Insert pictures, video*
---

"3.4 Glitch raiding is NOT ALLOWED. Glitching is anything that may involve you needing to log in or out to access a part of a base, being â€œpushedâ€ into a base, getting knocked unconscious to get inside, etc."

During this raid we put up two fireplaces, partly over a hatch, along with some planterboxes and a water barrel to block the view, still placed in a way so you could vault up or dismantle one of the fireplaces to gain access to that floor
Here is a video showing how it looked when the raider gained access, did he glitch in or not? *Insert video*
---

"3.5 When raiding, you may not destroy their whole base in an attempt to grief or gain materials. You may only destroy the walls absolutely necessary to raid."

This is pretty much a repeat of rule 1.5, dismantling windows and floors without any reason but to grief, because they already had access. Far from the "whole base" as you written in the rules, but is it not still a breach of the rules?
--------------------------------------------

Furthermore:
Also from my understanding, one of their team members has today been perma banned for cheating. Does this not include team members for association with a proven cheater?
When we first joined GroundZero we were split into two teams of five, apparently one guy on the second team there was caught using speedhack and the result then, was that hole group recieved a ban.
I would think, and hope, for some consistency in the ruling and the same penalty would be applied when the reason for the ban is the same, not the same cheat but still using cheats

--------------------------------------------

Personal note:

I'm not writting this because I want compensation or more players banned even if it might sound that way..
I would like to see the rules that are stated, to be enforced in the right manner with consistency and not desided on, what seems, a whim
