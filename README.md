Dispute over rules


After reflecting over last nights events during a base raid that occured, I feel I need to write this ticket for the staff of GZ to read
------------------------------------------

From the GroundZero rulebook:

"1.5 Do NOT grief other players. Griefing is shooting ruining or despawning loot, shooting damaging or uncovering vehicles, and dismantling any part of a base that's not needed for entry."

The raiders uncovered the car, shot it and hit it during the entire time they were gaining access to the base. They also dismantled 2 triangle floors at the top of the base and 2 windows inside, were very clearly not required to gain entry into the base.
(They were already in that area by legal means, such as with bombs and raidsledges) Insert pictures, video
---

"3.4 Glitch raiding is NOT ALLOWED. Glitching is anything that may involve you needing to log in or out to access a part of a base, being â€œpushedâ€ into a base, getting knocked unconscious to get inside, etc."

During this raid we put up two fireplaces, partly over an access hatch, along with some planter boxes and a water barrel to block the raiders view of the room. These items were still placed in a way that players could quite easily vault up in one direction, or dismantle one of the fireplaces to gain access to that floor. When the raiders DID, however, gain access, they simply â€œappearedâ€ in the room, without any vault animation at all.
Here is a video showing how it looked when the raider gained access, did he glitch in or not? *Insert video*
---

"3.5 When raiding, you may not destroy their whole base in an attempt to grief or gain materials. You may only destroy the walls absolutely necessary to raid."

This is pretty much a repeat of rule 1.5, dismantling windows and floors without any reason whatsoever but to grief, because they already had access. Far from the "whole base" as you written in the rules, but is it not still a breach of the rules, as these components were definitely unnecessary in terms of gaining access to the base. Two of the dismantled floors were even OUTSIDE the base, leading to absolutely nowhere.
--------------------------------------------

Furthermore:
Also from my understanding, one of their team members has today been perma banned for cheating. Does this not include team members for association with a proven cheater?
When we first joined Ground Zero some months ago, a group we had our eyes on received a full team ban. One of their members were proven to be using hacks, and the entire group was banned for association with the cheater. 
I would think, and hope, for some consistency in the ruling and the same penalty would be applied when the reason for the ban is the same.

--------------------------------------------

Personal note:

I'm not writing this because I want compensation or more players banned even if it might sound that way. I would simply like to see the published server rules to be enforced in the right manner, and with a level of consistency â€“ not deliberated upon and enforced on a whim.
With that said, I don't know what goes into the admin work, 300 tickets a day on 3 different servers.. I understand that consistency might not always be the name of the game
